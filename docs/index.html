<h1 id="hanover-stats-labs">Hanover Stats Labs</h1>
<p>This site is a repository of information related to statistics instruction at Hanover College. Here you will find resources regarding the use of R and R-Studio, as well as details about our lab assignments.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="labs.html">Our labs</a> are a great place to start. They gradually introduce you to the various features of R and R-Studio.</li>
<li><a href="commands.html">Summary of the commands</a> we use can be found here. Use it as a reference for enhancing the commandâ€™s output if the default behavior is not quite what you wanted. We have purposefully restricted ourselves to a small subset of the R language, based on the work of <a href="http://mosaic-web.org/">Project MOSAIC</a>.</li>
<li><a href="various.html">Various resources</a> with further links.</li>
<li><a href="login.html">Login instructions</a> for those that do not need to follow our labs above. This page has brief information on how to log in to the Hanover College RStudio server.</li>
<li>Self-installation instructions TODO</li>
