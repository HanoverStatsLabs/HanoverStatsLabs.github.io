<h1>The different sections and panes in RStudio</h1>
<ul>
<li>The RStudio window consists of 3-4 different sections.</li>
<li>Each section can present different kinds of information, called <em>panes</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>Console</em> pane is by default the one on the left or lower-left. It is the place where we directly type R commands to be executed.</li>
<li>The <em>Environment</em> pane is typically in the top right section. It shows all the active objects in your current session. When we store new data sets or computations, a summary of those objects will appear there.</li>
<li>The <em>History</em> pane contains a list of all previously executed commands. You can use it to quickly recall a previous command and reintroduce it into the Console by double-clicking.</li>
<li>The <em>Files</em> pane provides you access to your files on the RStudio server. Typically you would create a new folder for each analysis project.</li>
<li>The <em>Plots</em> pane is where generated graphs appear. You can click the left-right arrows in the pane to scroll through the various plots you have created. You can also click the Zoom button for a larger view of the graph in its own window.</li>
<li>The <em>Packages</em> pane lists the available <a href="packagesAsToolboxes.html">packages</a> and add-ons which can be used to enhance Râ€™s capabilities. The already loaded packages are shown with a check mark.</li>
<li>The <em>Help</em> pane gives you access to R documentation for additional info on a command. The information provided by some documentation pages may be somewhat overwhelming and confusing. The <a href="../commands.html">commands list page</a> and the <a href="../morsels.html">morsels</a> pages provide more easily digestible amounts of information, more suitable for beginners.</li>
</ul>
