# The different sections and panes in RStudio

- The RStudio window consists of 3-4 different sections.
- Each section can present different kinds of information, called *panes*.
- The *Console* pane is by default the one on the left or lower-left. It is the place where we directly type R commands to be executed.
- The *Environment* pane is typically in the top right section. It shows all the active objects in your current session. When we store new data sets or computations, a summary of those objects will appear there.
- The *History* pane contains a list of all previously executed commands. You can use it to quickly recall a previous command and reintroduce it into the Console by double-clicking.
- The *Files* pane provides you access to your files on the RStudio server. Typically you would create a new folder for each analysis project.
- The *Plots* pane is where generated graphs appear. You can click the left-right arrows in the pane to scroll through the various plots you have created. You can also click the Zoom button for a larger view of the graph in its own window.
- The *Packages* pane lists the available [packages](packagesAsToolboxes.md) and add-ons which can be used to enhance R's capabilities. The already loaded packages are shown with a check mark.
- The *Help* pane gives you access to R documentation for additional info on a command. The information provided by some documentation pages may be somewhat overwhelming and confusing. The [commands list page](../commands.md) and the [morsels](../morsels.md) pages provide more easily digestible amounts of information, more suitable for beginners.
