# Loading built-in data

The various R packages contain a number of existing datasets that are easy to load. The main command used to access these datasets is `data`:

```r
data()           # Brings up list of all available datasets, grouped by package
data(counties)   # Loads the dataset named counties
help(counties)  # We can find information about the dataset before or after loading
```
