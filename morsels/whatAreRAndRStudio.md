# What are R and RStudio

## R

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language specifically designed to perform statistical work. It has been designed from the ground up with that goal in mind.
- It is freely available for use and has a strong community of developers supporting it.
- One of its most exciting facilities is [R-Markdown documents](whatAreRMarkdownDocuments.md) which allow you to combine the code for statistical computations together with your analysis into a single document, which leads to what is known as **reproducible research**.
- A lot of the power of R comes from the various add-on [packages](packagesAsToolboxes.md) that can be installed and enhance/customize the language's capabilities. Whatever your particular data analysis needs are, chances are there's a package for you.

## RStudio

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a user-friendly environment for working with the R language. The RStudio team offers a number of packages and commercial versions, as well as a quite powerful free version.
- While you can install RStudio on your own local machine, we will be using an **RStudio Server** setup on the Hanover College servers, which allows us to manage the installation in one centralized location.
- Most importantly our RStudio server can be accessed through standard web browsers from anywhere in the world as long as you have valid Hanover College credentials.
