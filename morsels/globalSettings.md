# Global R Studio settings

RStudio has a lot of customization options, typically found in the "Tools -> Global Options" menu. Here are some of the important ones:

- Under the "Appearance" section, you can customize the overall color theme and size of the code sections.
- Under the "Pane Layout" section, you can choose what should appear in each of the four sections of the window.
- Under the "RMarkdown" section you can set up some behaviors regarding RMarkdown documents. Most notably, the "Show output preview in" option allows you to have the preview in a new window or in the viewer pane (recommended).
