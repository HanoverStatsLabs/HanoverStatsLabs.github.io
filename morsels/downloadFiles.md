# Downloading files from the RStudio workspace

In order to download one or more files from the RStudio workspace, follow these steps:

- In the *Files* pane, typically situated in the bottom right section of the screen, navigate the folder structure until you are in the folder where the files are located.
- Click the checkbox(es) to the left of any files you wish to download.
- Still in the *Files* pane, click the gear button on the right, and choose the "Export" option. If you had selected multiple files, a compressed zip file will be generated instead.
- You may change the name of the file if you like. Then click the "Download" button to have the file downloaded.
