# Working with the R Console

- You can use the R Console to interact with the R programming language.
- The R Console includes a variety of features intended to make working with R more productive and straightforward, including: *code completion*, *command history* and access to *help*.
- Code completion:
    - In the Console, you might begin typing a command and then be unsure if you're spelling it correctly. You can activate the code completion feature by hitting the `<tab>` button. This will bring up a list of possible completions. You can press `<esc>` to cancel that list of options, and you can use the arrows keys and hit `<tab>` (or select via your mouse) to choose a completion.
- Command history:
    - As you work with R, you'll often want to re-execute a command which you previously entered, possibly with some changes.
    - The RStudio Console supports the ability to recall previous commands using the arrow keys. You can scroll through the history in both directions by using the up/down arrow keys while in the Console pane. A common workflow is to incrementally build a task by starting with a simple command, then using the up arrow to recall it and extend it by adding more steps.
    - You can also use the [*History* pane](RStudioSections.md) in the upper-right section to see a list of all previously entered commands. Double-clicking any of these commands will paste it into the Console.
- Getting help:
    - In the Console, use a prepended `?` to pull up the R documentation for any R command. For instance, typing `?print` in the console will bring up the documentation for the `print` command.
    - Alternativaly you can use the `help` command: `help(print)`
