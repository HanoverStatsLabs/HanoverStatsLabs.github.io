# RStudio projects

- RStudio projects are basically directories (folders) on your RStudio webspace that contain everything related to a particular project.
- To start a new project:
    - Go to "File -> New Project", then choose "New Directory" and then "Empty Project".
    - Give the directory a name (avoid using spaces and other special symbols) and choose its parent directory.
    - Click on "Create Project" to create the project.
    - You should now be seeing a fresh session, and the "Files" pane should be showing the new directory.
- A special file will be created in this folder, with extension `Rproj` and named after the project. You can double-click this file later on to "reactivate" the project.
- A typical project directory will contain the special project file, one or more [RMarkdown documents](rmarkdown.md) and their derivatives, uploaded datasets etc.
