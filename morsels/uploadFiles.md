# Uploading files to the RStudio workspace

To upload a file to the RStudio workspace, follow these steps:

- In the *Files* pane, typically situated in the bottom right section of the screen, navigate the folder structure until you are in the folder where you want the new file to be. If you have a [project](projects.md) set up, this may already be all set.
- Still in the *Files* pane, click the "Upload" button, then use the "Choose File" dialog to find the file you want to upload.
- Click OK. Your file should now be in the RStudio workspace and ready for use.
