# R Packages

- The core R language is relatively small.
- A lot of its power comes from *packages* that you can load.
- These packages add new commands and capabilities.
- Think of them as *toolboxes*: Depending on what task you want to do, you load corresponding packages.
- Our [hanoverbase](hanoverbasePackage.md) is a package we have put together that collects in one place the functionality provided by many useful packages. You would usually want to load this package, as many of the commands we use require it.
- You can see what packages are avialable in the "Packages" pane in the bottom right section.
- You can *load* a package to activate it, using the `library` method, like so: `library(hanoverbase)`
