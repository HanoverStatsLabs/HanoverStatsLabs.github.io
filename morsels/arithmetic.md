# Basic arithmetic and use of scientific notation in R

- The R Console can be used as a basic calculator: For example you can compute the standard 15% tip on a $16.99 bill by typing `0.15 * 16.99` and hitting Enter.
- You can use parentheses to enforce a specific order of operations.
- The caret symbol `^` can be used for powers. for example `2 ^ 4` would produce the fourth power of 2, i.e. 16.
- Very large or very small numbers can be entered using scientific notation. For example, we can enter the number of 3.2 millions as `3.2e6` and the number of `0.000016` as `1.6e-5`.
- Depending on the number of digits of the number in question, R may choose to display it via either decimal or scientific notation.
