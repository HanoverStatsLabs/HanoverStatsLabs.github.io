# Getting ready to work

When working with R and R-Studio, it is a good idea to have multiple browser tabs open at the same time.

- One tab where you are [logged in to R-Studio](loggingToRStudio.md).
- One tab pointing to the [main resources page](../index.md). There are numerous useful links there, for example the various [Morsels](../morsels.md) as well as other cheatsheets.
- Additional tab for any cheatsheets or google searches you require.
