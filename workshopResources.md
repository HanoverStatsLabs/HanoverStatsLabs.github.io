# Workshop-related resources

## Books

While there are a large number of resources available for R, the following form a core start point:

1. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is available online and can also be purchased from various sellers. It is a solid introduction to using the tidyverse set of packages and working with R in general.
2. [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/331924275X/) is an excellent in-depth look at the ggplot2 package and its capabilities.
3. [Linear Models with R](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Models-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439887330) discusses linear modeling with a more practical viewpoint and using a lot of R code in the process.
4. [Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models](https://www.amazon.com/Extending-Linear-Model-Generalized-Nonparametric/dp/149872096X/) discusses more advanced modeling, including topics like Logistic Regression, Random Effects and Repeated Measures.
5. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370) is a great broad introduction to various topics related to statistical learning.

## Cheatsheets
