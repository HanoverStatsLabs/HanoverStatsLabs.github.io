# Hanover Stats Labs

This site is a repository of information related to statistics instruction at Hanover College. Here you will find resources regarding the use of R and R-Studio, as well as details about our lab assignments.

- [Our labs](labs.md) are a great place to start. They gradually introduce you to the various features of R and R-Studio.
- [A cheatsheet](cheatSheet.md) for basic R and RStudio functionality.
- [Summary of the commands](commands.md) we use can be found here. Use it as a reference for enhancing the command's output if the default behavior is not quite what you wanted. We have purposefully restricted ourselves to a small subset of the R language, based on the work of [Project MOSAIC](http://mosaic-web.org/).
- A quick [R Markdown Syntax](rmarkdownBasics.md) sheet.
- [Various resources](various.md) with further links.
- [Login instructions](login.md) for those that do not need to follow our labs above. This page has brief information on how to log in to the Hanover College RStudio server.
- Self-installation instructions TODO
