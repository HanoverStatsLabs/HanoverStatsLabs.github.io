# RStudio Login Instructions

The college is running an RStudio server, providing all Hanover College member access to RStudio via their web browser. The steps you need to follow are these:

- Open your browser to [rstudio.hanover.edu](http://rstudio.hanover.edu).
- Use your Hanover College login and password.
- After a short interval, you should be seeing the basic RStudio interface.
- We have prepared a package that loads many other standard packages. To load the package, type `library(hanoverbase)` at the Console pane in the bottom left.
